# Word Sorter

This is a simple Java program that:
- Extracts words from a given text string.
- Sorts them alphabetically using the **bubble sort** algorithm.

## Word Definition:
A word is defined as a sequence of letters (A-Z, a-z). All punctuation is removed, and the words are converted to lowercase before sorting.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `SortWords.java` file to see the words from the soliloquy sorted alphabetically.
